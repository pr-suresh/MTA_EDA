# Exploratory Data Analysis of MTA turnstile Data

## Abstract 
The goal of this project is to find the best location to start a coffee shop by analyzing foot traffic patterns in various subways locations in NYC using MTA turnstile Data. I used the data for 4 months of the year which fall in 4 different seasons. Further I made some visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib to check which time of the day is the most busiest, so that the coffee shop can be staffed based on that.

## Design 
In order to find the best spot for a coffee store there are multiple things to be considered, foot traffic being a key component. Using the turnstile data, we can see which stations are the busiest and at what time.

## Data 
To explore the data for possible options, I imported the data from MTA website for the months of Sep 2020, Dec 2020, Mar 2021, June 2021 and did some cleaning of the data by removing duplicate rows and calculating actual entries and exits from the cumulative values in the raw data set.

## Tools 
SQLAlchemy for creating tables and retrieving data

NumPy and Pandas for data cleaning, analysis 

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

## Communication 
I have answered the key questions using the slides and visualizations that can used to decide the right location for the coffee shop.
